# DENO NODE REACT FULL-STACK APP

I made the same full stack applicaiton with both node and deno as a backend.
These apps use the same react frontend.
As the backend run on port 5000 both backend services cannot be running at the same time.

>Make sure to install dependencies in react and node-api folder using 
```bash
npm install
```
